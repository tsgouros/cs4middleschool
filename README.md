      A Computer Science Curriculum for the Middle Schools


This curriculum was designed as a supplement to the "tech readiness"
curriculum employed in many middle schools.  Most tech readiness
curricula treat the computer as a mere device to be used, a black box
that runs browsers, word processors, and spreadsheets.  But the
computer is much more than that: it is a tool that is shaping our
future, and it is also a tool that a user can shape.  The applications
of tomorrow are very likely going to bear only a passing resemblance
to the ones in use today.  Students should be equipped not only to
operate today's computer programs, but to understand computers well
enough to operate the programs of tomorrow.  And some students may
create those programs.  All students should be aware of that
possibility.

The goal of this curriculum is to provide basic familiarity with a
broad range of computer science concepts.  By the end of the
curriculum, students will be able to understand the components of a
simple computer program well enough to be able to modify it and
successfully change its function.  This will provide a base of
understanding for learning to design and write a program from scratch
in the future, though that is not a necessary part of this
curriculum.

This curriculum was developed at the Learning Community, a public
charter school in Central Falls, Rhode Island during the 2014--2015
academic year.  It was meant to be the first of three successive years
of lessons, with the second and third years looping through similar
material, adding more advanced concepts with each pass.
